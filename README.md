# 👁️ Facial Recognition using TensorFlow

This project implements a **facial recognition system** that identifies and classifies human faces using a deep learning model built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
It was developed as a collaborative effort between **Youssef Azmy**,  **Omar Gohary**,  **Hazem Osama** and  **Youssef Mohamed Shaheen**, focusing on understanding how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn to recognize facial features and patterns.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build and train a CNN model capable of:
- Detecting and classifying faces from an image dataset.
- Distinguishing between different individuals (e.g., celebrity faces).
- Demonstrating how deep learning can be applied to facial recognition tasks.

Key stages of the work include:
1. **Dataset Preparation:** Organizing and preprocessing facial image data.
2. **Model Architecture:** Designing a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.
3. **Training & Validation:** Training the model for multiple epochs and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
4. **Evaluation:** Measuring accuracy, loss, and visualizing performance metrics.
5. **Output Visualization:** Displaying predictions and model outputs.
